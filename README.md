## Gameplay

There are 3 main stages in the game:
  - tap the start
  - tilt head to choose
  - see answer and tap to continue

From left to right:
- Start the game screen by tapping on the screen
- Users can now tilt their heads to choose an answer
- Users will not be able to see each other's answers but instead a cloud bubble until everyone chooses
- if everyone picks the same one emojis will show up
- if different answers are picked then you will be flash the color you picked
